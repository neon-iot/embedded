# Real-Time Embedded Systems Course
## About this course
The student will approve the course by performing hands-on laboratories and a real-time embedded systems project. The project includes writing a technical report about the designed system and an oral presentation.
This course consists of 22 hours of lectures, 16 hours of hands-on laboratory, 10 hours for consultations, 2 hours for evaluation, and 80 hours to develop the project. The course lasts seventeen weeks.
The responsible for this course is Julián Oreggioni at FING/UDELAR, Montevideo, Uruguay.

## Main topics
* **Introduction and basic concepts.** Introduction to embedded systems and real-time embedded systems, hardware for embedded systems, embedded-software development methodologies.
* **Microcontrollers and interrupts.** Microprocessor and microcontroller architectures, peripherals, interrupt basics, latency, shared-data problem.
* **Embedded software architectures.** Round-Robin, Round-Robin with interrupts, function-queue-scheduling, and real-time operating system. Architecture analysis and selection.
* **Introduction to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).** Tasks and task-states, scheduler, tasks and data, and semaphores and shared data. Messages queues, mailboxes, and pipes. Timer functions, events, memory management, and interrupt service routines in an RTOS environment.
* **Low-power embedded systems.** Techniques to reduce power/energy consumption both at circuit-level and at system-level. Low-power programming.
* **Basics of embedded systems design.** General criteria design and RTOS specific criteria.
* **Other embedded systems topics.** Model-based design, test and reliability techniques for critical systems, other topics of RTOS.

## What you will learn
The student will learn the fundamentals of embedded systems and real-time embedded systems. Those encompass concepts related to typical hardware of embedded systems to different software architectures.
The student will learn how to design, develop and test embedded systems considering power/energy consumption, timing, and memory constraints. In particular, in the end-of-course project, the student will face a real problem and solve it by implementing an embedded system.

## What you will need:
**Required skills**
* **High-level programming (C language).** Modular programming, encapsulation, and advanced data types (i.e., pointers, arrays, structs, and unions).
* **Fundamental concepts about microprocessors.** Addressing modes, machine language, stack, assembler language, instruction set, interrupts, and subroutines.
* **Digital electronics.** MOSFET as a switch and digital circuits. Logical levels and noise margin, propagation times, rise and fall times, static and dynamic power consumption. Basic CMOS logic gates, logic gates with open-drain/collector output or tri-state. TTL logic levels.

**Required hardware**
* An [MSP-EXP430G2ET](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430G2ET) launchpad from Texas Instruments.
* A PC with [Code Composer Studio](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) IDE installed.
* Analog Discovery 2 from Digilent (or oscilloscope, signal generator, logic analyzer, and variable power supply).
* Sensors [BoosterPack](https://www.ti.com/tool/BOOSTXL-SENSORS) plug-in module from Texas Instruments.
